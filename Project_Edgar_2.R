#Your company owns a chain of stores across Russia that sell a variety of alcoholic drinks. 
#The company recently ran a wine promotion in Saint Petersburg that was very successful. 
#Due to the cost to the business, it isn’t possible to run the promotion in all regions.
#The marketing team would like to target 10 other regions that have similar buying habits 
#to Saint Petersburg where they would expect the promotion to be similarly successful.

#The marketing team has sourced you with historical sales volumes per capita for several different drinks types.

"beer" - sale of beer in litres by year per capita
"vodka" - sale of vodka in litres by year per capita
"champagne" - sale of champagne in litres by year per capita
"brandy" - sale of brandy in litres by year per capita

#Data Preparation
#This scenario is perfect to apply unsupervised machine learning technique hierarchical cluster. 
#On this way, we need to be sure that we do not have any missing values. 
#Let’s start our analysis with this. 
#It is important to say that we will use svc for sales volume per capita, the basic unit that we will work.

#brandy, champagne, and wine show similar sales.

#them behavior is more influential and the total sales show almost the same shape of them.

#Modeling Data
#Our strategy to apply the clustering technique will be split our model into two steeps:
#1st: region selection considering Saint Petersburg market size and behavior; and,
#2nd: drink selection considering Wine in Saint Peterburg on the region of 1st steep.
#On each steep we will try to find the closer number of regions and drinks that our marketing team 
#ask plus one (10 + 1), considering Saint Petersburg is the plus one. Let's do some data wrangling.

  #1.if more data is available, our model could be more robust. 
      #Information about market in each region could show other results. 
      #For example, number of customers, profits, taxes, logistics costs, 
        #and many others, could be used to generate value for our analysis.

  #2.other strategy could be apply with this same model is reduce the time window.
    #For example, we can use different number of years and select the regions and drinks that appear more times.

  #3.on the other hand, we could try other algorithm like k-means to cluster and them apply the same cut strategy.
