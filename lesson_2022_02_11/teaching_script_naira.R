# Linear regression

# Predict median value of owner-occupied homes using % of population with lower status and age of building


# Question: which variables are significant?


# Question: run the same regression with lstat and and rm. What changes?

# Logistic regression

# Recode the medv variable to create a new variable "expensive" which is equal to 1
# if medv is higher or equal to 25, and 0 otherwise
Boston_expensive <- Boston %>% 
  mutate(expensive = ifelse(medv >= 25, "expensive", "other")) %>%

#Split the data between a training and a test set



# Now run a logistic regression of expensive depending on lstat and average number of rooms


# Question: which variables are significant?


# Predict whether an area is expensive or not for our test data


# Convert predictions to factors to compare with real values


# Create a confusion matrix - how good is the prediction?


# Draw a ROC curve and calculate AUC


##########################################
# Train a model using 5-fold cross-validation


# Print the model


# Predict whether an area is expensive or not for our test data


# Create a confusion matrix - how good is the prediction?
